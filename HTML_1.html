CHAP. 6.-And it came to pass, after the children of men had increased in those days,
beautiful and comely daughters were born to them. 2. And the angels, the sons of the
heavens, saw and lusted after them, and said one to another: "Behold, we will choose for
ourselves wives from among the children of men, and will beget for ourselves children." 3.
And Semjaza, who was their leader, said to them: "I fear that perhaps ye will not be willing
to do this deed, and I alone shall suffer for this great sin." 4. Then all answered him and said:
"We all will swear an oath, and bind ourselves mutually by a curse, that we will not give up
this plan, but will make this plan a deed." 5. Then they all swore together, and bound
themselves mutually by a curse; and together they were two hundred. 6. And they descended
on Ardis, which is the summit of Mount Hermon; and they called it Mount Hermon, because
they had sworn on it and bound themselves mutually by a curse. 7. And these are the names
of their leaders: Semjaza, who was their leader, Urakibarameel, Akibeel, Tamiel, Ramuel,
Danel, Ezeqeel, Saraqujal, Asael, Armers, Batraal, Anani, Zaqebe, Samsaveel, Sartael, Turel,
Jomjael, Arazjal. 8. These are the leaders of the two hundred angels, and the others all were
with them.
